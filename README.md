ðŸ’¼ Personal Portfolio Website â€“ Built with React & Tailwind CSS
This is my personal developer portfolio crafted using React and Tailwind CSS, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in a clean and responsive layout. The site features a dark/light mode toggle, animated starry background, smooth scroll navigation, and well-structured sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

With over 2 years of hands-on experience, Iâ€™ve used this project to highlight my strengths in frontend development, UI/UX design, and project management. The interface emphasizes usability and interactivity, built with performance and user experience in mind.

ðŸ’¡ Fully responsive, fast-loading, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
